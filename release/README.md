#Releases

This directory contains the release notes - a doc for each release.

Each release is tagged as `version-#` (with # being the release number) - this matches the filenames
in this directory.

I'm only using single release numbers and not [semantic numbering scheme](http://semver.org/).
This reflects that releases will be linear (1, 2, 3) and cumulative. Previous versions won't be patched
 so the upgrade path is easy - just get the newest version.

I'm trying to plan work using the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/pomes/pomes/issues).
